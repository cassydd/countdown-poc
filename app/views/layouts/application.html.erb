			<h2>About Countdown</h2>
			<p>
				This is a small project by me to provide extra functionality to the image countdown timers that I sometimes see in
				forums without injecting any scripting that may be rejected by the forum software. You can plonk down a timer that a user
				can click on and be taken to a page that will show all of the still-active timers that they have clicked on. If you're on
				this page after clicking on a timer, you can give the timer a descriptive title on this page and you can set up an email notification
				to warn you when the timer is going to expire or you can set up a calendar event in Google calendar.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no logging in. A single cookie is set to track which timers the user has clicked on. Your email address is scrubbed 
				from the system as soon as the email has been sent.
			</p>
			<p>
				The code for this little application is <a href="https://github.com/cassydd/countdown-poc">on Github</a>. The code is available under the MIT license so feel free to fork and roll your own GIF timer.
