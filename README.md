## Countdown Proof-of-concept

A bare-bones ruby on rails application that allows a user to generate an animated GIF (pronounced 'jif') of a timer counting
down to zero. A user is also then able to click a link to view a list of timers that they've clicked and even send email notifications
when the timer is about to expire.
